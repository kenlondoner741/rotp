Watford will look to extend the space between them and the relegation zone in their Premier League match against West Ham on Tuesday.

Claudio Ranieri’s side are just two points from the danger zone, with the Watford coach having told the club website recently: “The ambition is to be safe at the end, the Premier League is an important thing for Watford and for me, this is the goal and the target I have in my mind.”

MONTREAL CANADIENS vs TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING team news
There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the Watford team, who have not played since December 10 due to a number of positive Covid cases. The club have not confirmed which players will be available.

Ben Foster (groin), Ismaila Sarr (knee), Christian Kabasele (calf), Peter Etebo (quad) and Nicolas Nkoulou (hamstring) are all still out with injury.

David Moyes will be without Declan Rice, in what is a big blow to the Hammers as they look to regain some form. The England midfielder was booked on Boxing Day against Southampton and misses out through suspension.

Kurt Zouma and Angelo Ogbonna are still out long-term, while there is still no certain return date for Aaron Cresswell. Michail Antonio is expected to return to the starting lineup.

MONTREAL CANADIENS vs TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING prediction
It promises to be a tricky afternoon for West Ham, against a Watford team that are well-rested after having a number of matches postponed.

Ranieri’s side ran Chelsea and Man City close at home earlier in December, and will be confident of testing West Ham who are far from their best at the moment and will be without the midfield presence of Rice.

West Ham will face a rested Watford in the Premier League on Tuesday, after the Hornets’ Boxing Day clash with Wolves was called off because of a coronavirus outbreak.

Watford asked the Premier League for that game to be postponed but will have enough players returning from isolation to fulfil the fixture against the Hammers.

The game will be the last of what has been a memorable 2021 for David Moyes’ side, who qualified for Europe with their sixth-placed finish last season and are already looking forward to the knockout stages of the Europa League in the New Year.

Watford manager Claudio Ranieri will have a number of players available when his side host West Ham on Tuesday after they had been in isolation due to Covid-19 protocols.

The Hornets have not played since their 2-1 defeat at Brentford on December 10, and there have been more positive tests. The club have confirmed some players will be able to return but have not provided names.

Francisco Sierralta has recovered from a hamstring injury sustained last month and is expected to be available, but Ben Foster (groin), Ismaila Sarr (knee), Christian Kabasele (calf), Peter Etebo (quad) and Nicolas Nkoulou (hamstring) remain sidelined.

Watford provisional squad: Bachmann, Femenia, Troost-Ekong, Cathcart, Sierralta, Ngakia, Kucka, Sissoko, Hernandez, Cleverley, King, Dennis, Rose, Louza, Joao Pedro, Sema, Fletcher, Tufan, Elliot, Angelini

West Ham are without Declan Rice through suspension. The England midfielder collected his fifth booking of the season during the Boxing Day defeat by Southampton.

Defenders Aaron Cresswell, Angelo Ogbonna and Kurt Zouma are still out injured.

West Ham provisional squad: Fabianski, Coufal, Dawson, Diop, Johnson, Soucek, Lanzini, Fornals, Bowen, Antonio, Benrahma, Areola, Ashby, Baptiste, Masuaku, Noble, Kral, Vlasic, Yarmolenko.

I've made it an absolute artform out of getting West Ham wrong over the last 12 months. Boxing Day was another example. Southampton were clinical with their finishing and took advantage of a horrendous first half performance from the Hammers that left David Moyes as fuming as he's been since taking the job.

He said: "I could have changed four or five at half-time it was a difficult choice. The reaction has to come not in the dressing room but on the pitch and hopefully, they will put that right

West Ham have been consistent for such a long period of time, I'd be quite confident of Moyes getting the required reaction at Vicarage Road, especially if, as expected, Michail Antonio plays from the start. His introduction at half time sparked them into life. At 11/10 with Sky Bet, the Hammers are worth following.

A key area of the game will be set pieces. West Ham should be able to put Watford under significant pressure from them. Only two more teams have conceded more headed goals than Claudio Ranieri's side (6) whilst West Ham, along with Liverpool and Manchester City, have scored the most goals (7) from corners this season. In what could be a low-scoring affair where Moyes will be demanding a clear sheet, the 9/2 on a header being the method of the first goal is worth backing.
